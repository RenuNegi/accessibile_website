        Consumer Convenience vs. Sustainability &ndash; Sanitizer wipes<span>By: Evy Fung on 17/11/2020</span>

       Did you know that sanitizer wipes are loading up the landfills? It's convenient yet toxic to the
earth. The wipe contains plastic fibers and poses a danger to animals that mistake plastic bags
and wipes for their natural jellyfish prey. Wipes cause issues for sewage and can overflow into
rivers and the ocean.
    </p> 
    <p>
   Since wipes are not recyclable and just like plastic, it does not break down. We must find
alternatives. Below is the recipe to a DIY sustainable, homemade cleaning wipes solution.</p>
    <p>
    
        <b>Please note</b>: the lemon peel version will need 10&ndash;14 days to infuse in a lid jar and then to be strained.

            <li>1&ndash;2 Large quart&ndash;sized container with tight&ndash;fitting lid and/or a reusable spray bottle</li>
            <li>Cloths (try 2 old t&ndash;shirts, trace as many 8 x 8 inch squares and cut up)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup distilled water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp castile soap &ndash;or&ndash; 2 lemons peels, small bunch of fresh thyme sprigs, 
            2 cups distilled white vinegar (the lemon peel version will need 10&ndash;14 days to infuse in a lid jar and then to be strained)</li>
            <li>20&ndash;25 drops essential oil (optional, but not necessary; antibacterial options include tea tree, 
            thyme, and rosemary or some fun aromatherapy options include: lavender, lemon or orange)</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="pad-20">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>If using Castile Soap:</p>
        <ol class="blog-list-num">
            <li>Add the water and soap to the container and stir.</li>
            <li>Add essential oils, if using and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the cut&ndash;up cloth into the container, and press down to soak up all the solution.</li>

            <li>Use as needed for quick cleanups!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you've waited 10&ndash;14 days, for the Lemon Peel version:</p>
