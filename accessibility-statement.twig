                Uniformed Meditation is committed to providing a web experience that meets the needs of as
                many visitors as possible. We’re continually working to improve the accessibility and usability
                of our site, so that all users have an excellent experience. Our website, mobile applications,
                and other digital content are accessible to all customers, including those with disabilities.

            <h2>Measures to support accessibility</h2> 
            <p>
                Our on&ndash;going accessibility effort works towards conforming to the Web Content Accessibility
                Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1, level AA criteria. These guidelines not only help make web
                content accessible to users with sensory, cognitive and mobility disabilities, but ultimately to all
                users, regardless of ability. Therefore, we have adopted the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
                (WCAG) 21 Level AA as our Accessibility Standard and are continually working to maintain our
                web pages (and future apps) in substantial conformance with that Standard, as well as to provide
                the best possible user experience for everyone. We will be adding a TTY phone line in the near
                future.
